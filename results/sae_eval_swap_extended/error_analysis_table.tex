\caption{\textbf{Manual error analysis of 20 representative failure cases at $\alpha=10$ (Layer 6).} 
The table shows diverse failure modes when the steering strength is too high. 
\textbf{Key finding:} Despite failures, 18/20 (90\%) errors remain within the correct semantic category---producing a different major instead of the target major, a different city instead of the target city, etc. This suggests the SAE successfully identifies the \emph{type} of information to retrieve, but high $\alpha$ values cause it to select incorrect \emph{instances} within that category.
\textbf{Error patterns:} (1) \emph{Date errors}: Consistently default to the 15th of the month (6/20 cases); 
(2) \emph{Default answers}: ``Molson Coors'' (103$\times$), ``Richmond, VA'' (79$\times$); 
(3) \emph{Same-category substitution}: Wrong university/city/major but correct type (12/20 cases).
Success rate drops from 84.6\% at $\alpha=2$ to 23.4\% at $\alpha=10$.}
