COMPLETE ERROR ANALYSIS: Category Preservation in SAE Swap Evaluation
=========================================================================

CRITICAL FINDING: Errors predominantly stay within the correct semantic category
This demonstrates that the SAE successfully identifies the TYPE of information to retrieve,
but high steering strength (alpha) causes selection of incorrect INSTANCES within that type.

=========================================================================
SUMMARY STATISTICS
=========================================================================

Alpha = 2 (Success Rate: 84.6%, 154 errors out of 1000)
----------------------------------------------------------
Same Category: 115/154 (74.7%)
Different Category: 39/154 (25.3%)

Alpha = 10 (Success Rate: 23.4%, 766 errors out of 1000)
----------------------------------------------------------
Same Category: 636/766 (83.0%)  ← HIGHER than alpha=2!
Different Category: 130/766 (17.0%)

KEY INSIGHT: At higher alpha (10), category preservation IMPROVES from 74.7% to 83.0%
This suggests that strong steering makes the model MORE confident about the category type,
but LESS accurate about selecting the correct instance within that category.

DETAILED OBSERVATIONS
=========================================================================

1. DATE ERRORS (birth_date swap)
   --------------------------------
   - Alpha=2: 100% stay in date category (20/20 errors)
   - Alpha=10: 100% stay in date category (139/139 errors)
   - Pattern: ALL date errors remain dates, just wrong day/month/year
   - Common error: Default to 15th of the month at alpha=10

2. UNIVERSITY ERRORS (university swap)
   --------------------------------
   - Alpha=2: 80.8% stay in university category (42/52 errors)
   - Alpha=10: 99.0% stay in university category (101/102 errors)
   - Pattern: Generate different universities, not random words
   - High alpha makes category MORE clear, instance LESS accurate

3. EMPLOYER ERRORS (employer swap)
   --------------------------------
   - Alpha=2: 88.9% stay in company category (8/9 errors)
   - Alpha=10: 97.8% stay in company category (134/137 errors)
   - Pattern: Wrong company but still a company name
   - Alpha=10 shows "Molson Coors" default (103 times in full dataset)

4. CITY ERRORS (birth_city/work_city swap)
   --------------------------------
   - Birth city preservation: ~64% for both alphas (consistent)
   - Work city preservation: 56% (alpha=2) → 79% (alpha=10) (improved!)
   - Pattern: Generate other cities, sometimes with location mixing
   - Alpha=10 defaults: "San Diego", "Richmond, VA"

5. MAJOR ERRORS (major swap)
   --------------------------------
   - Alpha=2: Only 1 error, so statistics unreliable
   - Alpha=10: 60.2% stay in major category (77/128 errors)
   - Pattern: Wrong major but still academic fields
   - Common defaults: "Geography", "Criminology", "Statistics"

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PAPER
=========================================================================

1. SAE FEATURES ARE SEMANTICALLY COHERENT
   - Even when wrong, outputs stay within correct semantic category
   - 74-83% category preservation across conditions
   - Perfect preservation for dates (100%)

2. HIGH ALPHA IMPROVES CATEGORY CLARITY BUT REDUCES INSTANCE ACCURACY
   - Alpha=10: 83.0% category preservation vs Alpha=2: 74.7%
   - BUT success rate drops: 84.6% → 23.4%
   - Trade-off: clearer concept type, but wrong instance

3. FAILURE MODES ARE INTERPRETABLE
   - Not random generation or mode collapse to single token
   - Systematic errors: defaults to common entities within category
   - Date quantization to 15th
   - City defaults: San Diego, Richmond
   - Company defaults: Molson Coors

4. SAE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIES "WHAT TO RETRIEVE"
   - When swapping to "university", model outputs universities
   - When swapping to "major", model outputs majors
   - When swapping to "date", model outputs dates
   - The TYPE is correct, the INSTANCE is wrong

5. CALIBRATION CHALLENGE
   - Alpha=2: Good accuracy (84.6%) but weaker steering
   - Alpha=10: Strong steering but poor instance selection
   - Need optimal alpha between 2-10 for best results

SUGGESTED TEXT FOR PAPER
=========================================================================

"To understand failure modes, we manually analyzed all 154 errors at α=2 
and 766 errors at α=10. Remarkably, 74.7% (α=2) and 83.0% (α=10) of errors 
remained within the correct semantic category—when swapping to 'university', 
the model outputs a university (just the wrong one); when swapping to 'major', 
it outputs a major field. This is most pronounced for dates, where 100% of 
errors across both α values remain dates (e.g., '15,May,1988' instead of 
'23,May,1988'). 

This high category preservation rate (74-83%) demonstrates that the SAE 
successfully identifies the TYPE of information to retrieve. The failure is 
in selecting the correct INSTANCE within that type. Interestingly, higher 
steering strength (α=10) actually improves category preservation from 74.7% 
to 83.0%, particularly for universities (81% → 99%) and employers (89% → 98%), 
suggesting that stronger steering makes the concept type clearer but introduces 
instance-level confusion, often defaulting to common entities like 'Molson Coors' 
(103 occurrences) or 'Geography' (common major default)."

Overall           |    74.7%  |    83.0%   |   +8.3pp

Despite lower overall success (84.6% → 23.4%), high α improves
category preservation, confirming successful concept type identification.
