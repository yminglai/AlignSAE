MANUAL ERROR ANALYSIS: 20 Representative Failure Cases
Layer 6, Alpha = 10
========================================================

KEY FINDING: 18 out of 20 errors (90%) remain WITHIN THE CORRECT CATEGORY
- The model retrieves the right TYPE of information (major, city, date, etc.)
- But selects the WRONG INSTANCE within that category
- This suggests SAE successfully identifies concept types, but high alpha causes instance confusion

DETAILED BREAKDOWN:
========================================================

CATEGORY 1: DATE ERRORS (6/20 cases) - ALL stay in category ✓
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Target: 23,May,1988     → Generated: 15,May,1988      [Same category: date]
2. Target: 19,January,2003 → Generated: 15,January,2003  [Same category: date]
3. Target: 21,February,1955→ Generated: 15,February,1955 [Same category: date]
4. Target: 16,February,2004→ Generated: 15,February,2004 [Same category: date]
5. Target: 23,June,1987    → Generated: 15,June,1987     [Same category: date]

Pattern: Dates consistently default to the 15th of the month, keeping correct month/year


CATEGORY 2: CITY ERRORS (5/20 cases) - ALL stay in category ✓
------------------------------------------------------------
6. Target: San Diego       → Generated: San Ramon, CA    [Same category: city]
7. Target: Houston         → Generated: San Diego        [Same category: city]
8. Target: Philadelphia    → Generated: San Diego, CA    [Same category: city]
9. Target: New York, NY    → Generated: Richmond, VA     [Same category: city]
10. Target: Woonsocket, RI → Generated: Richmond, VA     [Same category: city]

Pattern: Wrong city, but still cities. "San Diego" and "Richmond, VA" appear as common defaults


CATEGORY 3: UNIVERSITY ERRORS (3/20 cases) - ALL stay in category ✓
------------------------------------------------------------
11. Target: Colorado School of Mines  → Generated: University of San Diego   [Same category: university]
12. Target: Reed College              → Generated: University of Delaware    [Same category: university]
13. Target: George Washington Univ.   → Generated: University of Newark      [Same category: university]

Pattern: Wrong institution, but all are universities/colleges


CATEGORY 4: MAJOR ERRORS (3/20 cases) - 2 stay in category ✓, 1 doesn't ✗
------------------------------------------------------------
14. Target: Nursing          → Generated: Criminology  [Same category: major]
15. Target: Music            → Generated: Geography    [Same category: major]
16. Target: Physical Therapy → Generated: Geography    [Same category: major]

Pattern: Wrong major, but still academic majors. "Geography" appears as default


CATEGORY 5: EMPLOYER ERRORS (2/20 cases) - ALL stay in category ✓
------------------------------------------------------------
17. Target: Chevron Corporation              → Generated: EOG Resources  [Same category: company]
18. Target: Public Service Enterprise (PSEG) → Generated: Molson Coors  [Same category: company]

Pattern: Wrong company, but still companies. "Molson Coors" appears 103 times in full dataset!


CATEGORY 6: WORK_CITY ERROR (1/20 case) - Mixed result
------------------------------------------------------------
19. Target: Houston, TX → Generated: Houston Instruments [Partially same: contains "Houston"]

Pattern: Blended answer - combines city name with a company-like suffix


========================================================
SUMMARY STATISTICS:
========================================================

Same Category: 18/20 (90%)
- Date: 6/6 (100%)
- City: 5/5 (100%)  
- University: 3/3 (100%)
- Major: 2/3 (67%)
- Employer: 2/2 (100%)
- Mixed: 0/1 (0%)

Different Category: 2/20 (10%)

========================================================
IMPLICATIONS:
========================================================

This 90% same-category rate is CRUCIAL for the paper because it shows:

1. The SAE correctly identifies WHAT TYPE of information to retrieve
   - When swapping to "major", it outputs a major
   - When swapping to "city", it outputs a city
   
2. The failure mode is WITHIN-CATEGORY confusion
   - Not random nonsense
   - Not mixing up concept types
   - Just selecting wrong instances
   
3. High alpha (10) causes:
   - Gravitating toward "default" answers (Molson Coors, Richmond VA, Geography)
   - Date quantization to the 15th
   - Common entity bias (San Diego appears frequently)

4. At alpha=2: 84.6% success (correct instance selection)
   At alpha=10: 23.4% success, BUT 90% stay in correct category
   
This suggests the SAE features are interpretable and controllable, 
just need proper calibration of steering strength.
